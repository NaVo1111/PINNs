PINN Report
The problem: 2D flow around a cylinder in a channel.

===================================
Network Configuration
Number of hidden layers: None
Number of neurons per hidden layer: 60
Activation function: Tanh()
Other notes:Branched network. Hidden layers 3 shared + 7/9 in each branch (velocity/pressure). Velocity branch has 2 relu 5 tanh activations, the relu in the middle, pressure all tanh. Input normalization and normalized momentum loss, Xavier initialization.
===================================
The Domain
Number of collocation points: 98304
Wall Boundary points: 1000
Inlet Boundary points: 200
Outlet Boundary points: 200
The total length: 1.0
The inlet height: 0.2
Other notes:Cylinder info: center at x=0.2, y=0, radius=0.05, number of boundary wall points=100. batches over collocation points, num_batch 16384
===================================
The Boundary Conditions and Loss
Inlet Boundary Type: Velocity inlet
Maximum Velocity: 1.0
Velocity Profile: Parabolic velocity profile: U_max * (1 - (y/h0)^2)
Wall Boundary Type: No-slip
Outlet Boundary Type: Pressure outlet
Dynamic Viscosity: 0.001
Density of Fluid: 1000.0
Reynolds number: 5
Other notes:Loss branched, inlet, walls, and continuity to velocity, outlet to pressure, momentum to all. Loss  MSE.
===================================
