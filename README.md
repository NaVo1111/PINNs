# My PINNs

## The scripts

The jupyter notebooks are scripts for training a PINN.
Naming convention PINN_X_X_Description:
PINN_0: Models for 1D, steady, incompressible flow
PINN_1: Models for 2D, steady, incompressible flow
The remainder of the name is another number and a description. If I need to refer to the script again (for instance in results), the second number will be used and the description ommitted. 

Disclaimer: PINN_1_3 has not yet been worked on

## Functions folder

Includes all the functions used in the scripts, such as plots, for plotting results.

## Results

Results folder should include:
* the results plots, loss plots, and similar...
* the trained model
* the description of the model, settings used
